lolibc - C library implementation.

Why not use glibc, you might ask.

Well, glibc's building system is really really ugly, the code is old and ugly, and lot of stuff
isn't designed in a good way (good as in "a way that I like").

Rewriting it to be easily embeddable in a kernel, to be easily ported to new platforms and to be
easily optimized for new architectures, this is lolibc's aim.

At first it was just a "let's do it for lulzKey", but now I think I can get this to be something
useful.

I know that for the moment the license is a real open source nazi restriction, I'll change license
to LGPL someday, maybe.

At the moment the library isn't even compilable by GCC (clang is a lot smarter), so, have fun ^_^

Used software:
    - sys-devel/clang-9999 (SVN)
    - dev-lang/ruby-1.8.7
    - dev-ruby/rake-0.8.7
